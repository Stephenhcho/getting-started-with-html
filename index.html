    <h1>Important Concepts</h1>

<p>
<b>How the Web Works</b>
  
</p>

The web is a bunch of computers that communicate with each 
<br>other.When a person goes to a web page like www.google.com,
<br>their computer sends a 
<em>HTTP request</em> to a <em>server</em>. The server
<br> finds the appropriate HTML document and sends it back to the 
<br>user's computer where a <em>web browser</em> 
interprets the page and <br> displays it on the user's screen. <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/e-48329854/m-48480496">This video</a> does a good job of
<br>explaining.

<p>
<b>HTML</b>
  
</p>

HTML stands for <em>Hypertext Markup Language</em>. HTML 
<br>documents form the majority of the content on the web. HTML
<br>documents contain <em>text content</em> which describes "what you see"
<br>and <em>markup</em> which describes "how it looks". <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/e-48329854/m-48480496">This video</a> gives a
<br>good overview.

<p>
<b>Tags and Elements</b>
  
  
</p>
HTML documents are made of HTML <b>elements</b>. When writing 
<br>HTML, we tell browsers the type of each element by using
<br>HTML <b>tags</b>. <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/m-48723444">This video</a> explains the distinction well.

<p>
<b>Why Computers are Stupid</b>
  
</p>

Computers are stupid because they interpret instructions literally.
<br>This makes them very unforgiving since a small mistake by a 
<br>programmer can cause huge problems in a program.
<p><b>Inline vs Block Elements</b></p>
HTML elements are either <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b>. Block elements form
<br> an "invisible box" around the tent inside of them.
